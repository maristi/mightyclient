# MightyClient #

Please see the [overview document](https://github.com/ivan4427/mightyclient/blob/master/wiki/overview.md), [demo app](http://mightyclient.appspot.com/), and [source code for the demo app](https://github.com/ivan4427/mightyclient_demo).

For javascript unit tests to work, closure-library directory (or a symlink to it) needs to be placed in the root directory, and `deps.js` should be generated in `client/`.
